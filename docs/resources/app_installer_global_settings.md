# jamfpro_app_installer_global_settings (Resource)


## Example Usage
```terraform
resource "jamfpro_app_installer_global_settings" "jamfpro_app_installer_singleton" {
  notification_message  = "A new version of this app is ready to install."       # This message is shown to users when an app update becomes available.
  notification_interval = 24                                                     # Interval (in hours) between repeated user notifications about the update.
  deadline_message      = "Please install the update to continue using the app." # Message displayed when the deadline to update has passed.
  deadline              = 48                                                     # Deadline (in hours) after which the app is forcibly quit and updated.
  quit_delay            = 5                                                      # Additional time (in minutes) for users to save their work before the app quits.
  complete_message      = "Installation complete. You may now relaunch the app." # Message shown after successful installation.
  relaunch              = true                                                   # If true, the app will automatically relaunch after installation.
  suppress              = false                                                  # If true, no notifications will be shown to the end user.
