# jamfpro_smart_mobile_device_group (Resource)
Manages a Jamf Pro Smart Mobile Device Group using the `/api/v1/mobile-device-groups/smart-groups` endpoint.

## Example Usage
```terraform
resource "jamfpro_smart_mobile_device_group" "smart_example" {
  name = "Example Smart Mobile Device Group"

  # Optional: Provide a description
  description = "This is an example smart mobile device group created via Terraform."

  # Optional: Specify site details 
  site_id = 5

  # Optional: Define criteria for Smart groups
  criteria {
    name          = "Criterion Name #1"
    priority      = 0     # 0 is the highest priority, 1 is the next highest, etc.
    and_or        = "and" # or "or", defaults to "and" if not provided
    search_type   = "is"  # or any other supported search type
