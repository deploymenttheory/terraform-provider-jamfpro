# jamfpro_adcs_settings (Resource)
Manages Jamf Pro AD CS connector settings via the `/api/v1/pki/adcs-settings` endpoint.

## Example Usage
```terraform
resource "jamfpro_adcs_settings" "inbound_example" {
  display_name  = "tf-example-inbound-adcs"
  ca_name       = "Contoso Issuing CA"
  fqdn          = "connector.contoso.corp"
  adcs_url      = "https://connector.contoso.corp/certsrv"
  api_client_id = "c1bcec08-5f34-40fa-af52-9d3413ac916d"

  revocation_enabled = true
  outbound           = false

  server_certificate_filename = "server-certificate.pfx"
  server_certificate_data     = filebase64("./secrets/server-certificate.pfx")
  server_certificate_password = "serverCertPassw0rd!"

  client_certificate_filename = "client-certificate.pfx"
  client_certificate_data     = filebase64("./secrets/client-certificate.pfx")
  client_certificate_password = "clientCertPassw0rd!"
}

resource "jamfpro_adcs_settings" "outbound_example" {
  display_name  = "tf-example-outbound-adcs"
  ca_name       = "Contoso Issuing CA"
  fqdn          = "connector.contoso.corp"
  api_client_id = "c1bcec08-5f34-40fa-af52-9d3413ac916d"

  revocation_enabled = true

- `server_certificate_filename` (String) Filename that will be stored in Jamf Pro for the uploaded server certificate package.
- `server_certificate_password` (String, Sensitive) Password required to decrypt the server certificate package, if applicable.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
