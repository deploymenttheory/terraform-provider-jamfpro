# Terraform Provider for Jamf Pro

## Disclaimer

**This project is under active development, and new releases may introduce changes that are not backward compatible with previous versions. Users should be aware that older implementations may break with updates. We recommend thoroughly reviewing release notes and testing new versions in a staging environment before deploying to production.**

## Introduction

This repository hosts the Jamf Pro Community Provider, built to integrate Jamf Pro's robust configuration management capabilities with Terraform's Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach. Utilizing a comprehensive JAMF Pro SDK [go-api-sdk-jamfpro](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/go-api-sdk-jamfpro), which serves as a cohesive abstraction layer over both Jamf Pro and Jamf Pro Classic APIs, this provider ensures seamless API interactions and brings a wide array of resources under Terraform's management umbrella. The jamfpro provider is engineered to enrich your CI/CD workflows with Jamf Pro's extensive device management functionalities, encompassing device enrollment, inventory tracking, security compliance, and streamlined software deployment. Its primary goal is to enhance the efficiency of managing, deploying, and maintaining Apple devices across your infrastructure, fostering a synchronized and effective IT ecosystem.

The provider contains:

- Resources and data sources for Jamf Pro entities (`internal/provider/`),
- Examples [examples](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/terraform-provider-jamfpro/tree/main/examples) directory for sample configurations and usage scenarios of the `terraform-provider-jamfpro` provider.
- Documentation [docs](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/terraform-provider-jamfpro/tree/main/docs)

## Terraform Parallelism and JAMF Pro Resource Creation in Load Balanced Environments

Jamf Pro is frequently hosted in clustered configurations with loadbalancing with two or more web applications. Jamf Pro handles resource propagation between the web applications and in Jamfcloud configurations the propagation time is exactly 60s to align all web applications (2) in the cluster.

When creating resources in Jamf Pro, it is important to consider the propagation time of resources across the Jamf Pro web applications. When managing JAMF with Terraform it's possible for terraform to create a resource successfully, but when it comes to stating the resource it has a 50 / 50 chance that it might reach a web app that hasn't been propagated to yet. This can lead to a resource being created but not stated correctly and leads to orphaned resource scenario's.

On the terraform side, Terraform by default creates a http client for a terraform plan operation and a separate http client for terraform apply. The terraform apply http client once initialised is used for all operations for a given run. This is useful as it means we can implement support for sticky sessions within the http client to ensure that all operations are targeted to the same web app.

Mitigation Strategy:

[1] Utilise sticky sessions within the http client used by this terraform provider.

[2] Enforce a 60 second propagation delay for TF resource creation operations when sticky sessions are disabled.

[3] Ensure that terraform is run with a parallelism of 1 to ensure that resources are created and stated in a controlled manner. (suggested)

Sticky sessions can be enabled like this in the provider configuration:

```bash
provider "jamfpro" {
  enable_cookie_jar = true // or false
}
```

Behaviour Description [False] When disabled, the http client doesn't use sticky sessions and will honor the 60s propagation time of jamf pro in jamf cloud contexts to ensure successful TF resource stating. This results in a given resource creation task taking circa 1 minute to deploy across the board. This approach keeps the load on jamf pro light and when deploying during business hours, this may be the preferred  configuration to ensure that jamf pro api resources are available for various device management activities outside of terraform. The down side of this however is that will take longer for a terraform apply to complete which is pertinent during pipeline runs.

Behaviour Description [True] When enabled, the http client uses sticky sessions and will target all operations to a single jamf pro web app. This negates Jamf Pro's load balancing and results in increased load on the targeted web app. However it provides the benefit that resources can be deployed and stated faster. This is due to the assurance that the web app api that was targeted for resource creation, will always be the same as the web app api used for TF resource stating. The propagation time in this scenario is set to 5 rather than 60 seconds.

### Special note: Terraform parallelism

By default terraform runs 10 operations in parallel. During load testing I have observed that when terraform performs Create operations above 1 against jamf pro it frequently results in unreliable resource deployment behavior. E.g resources deployed with partial configuration leading to stating failure. This is due to the fact that the jamf pro API get's overwhelmed due to the concurrency of the Create requests. Consequently I advise when possible to run terraform with the following

```bash
terraform apply -parallelism=1
```

Which restricts terraform to a single operation at a time. From load testing with 500 resource creations, across 10 different resource types with the cookie jar is enabled I was able to deploy successfully and state all resources. Effectively a new resource was created and stated every 5 seconds.

If you are unable to control the parallelism of terraform due to your pipeline design then proceed cautiously when creating jamf resources in batches.
