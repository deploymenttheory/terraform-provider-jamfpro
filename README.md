## Introduction

This repository hosts the Jamf Pro Community Provider, built to integrate Jamf Pro's robust configuration management capabilities with Terraform's Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach. Utilizing a comprehensive JAMF Pro SDK [go-api-sdk-jamfpro](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/go-api-sdk-jamfpro), which serves as a cohesive abstraction layer over both Jamf Pro and Jamf Pro Classic APIs, this provider ensures seamless API interactions and brings a wide array of resources under Terraform's management umbrella. The jamfpro provider is engineered to enrich your CI/CD workflows with Jamf Pro's extensive device management functionalities, encompassing device enrollment, inventory tracking, security compliance, and streamlined software deployment. Its primary goal is to enhance the efficiency of managing, deploying, and maintaining Apple devices across your infrastructure, fostering a synchronized and effective IT ecosystem.

## Demo Implementation

To help you get started and understand the practical implementation of this provider, we've created a comprehensive demo repository:

- **Demo Repository**: [Terraform Demo Jamf Pro](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/terraform-demo-jamfpro)

This demo repository showcases a real-world implementation of the Jamf Pro Terraform provider. It's designed to:

1. Illustrate best practices for integrating Jamf Pro with Terraform.
2. Demonstrate a GitLab-flow based workflow for multi environment setups, integrating with Terraform Cloud.
3. Provide practical examples of managing Jamf Pro resources as code.
4. Offer a starting point for your own infrastructure-as-code initiatives with Jamf Pro.

We encourage you to explore this repository to:

- Understand how to structure your Terraform configurations for Jamf Pro.
- See examples of defining and managing various Jamf Pro resources.
- Learn how to integrate Terraform workflows with your CI/CD pipeline.
- Get insights into version control strategies for your Jamf Pro configurations.

Whether you're new to Terraform or looking to enhance your existing Jamf Pro management, this demo repository serves as a valuable resource to kickstart your infrastructure-as-code journey with Jamf Pro.

## Getting Started with Examples

# Provider Configuration for Jamf Pro in Terraform

This documentation provides a detailed explanation of the configuration options available in the `provider.tf` file for setting up the Jamf Pro provider in Terraform.


### Jamf Cloud Load Balancing and Cookies

- Jamf Cloud uses a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple web app members. This abstraction can cause issues with Terraform's http client when multiple instances are running in parallel. Where freqently the client will be communicating with different web app members, causing stating unfound resource issues.
- To mitigate this please use the `jamfpro_load_balancer_lock` (which enforces a single cookie across all parallel instances of Terraform operations) which extracts the correct cookie on first run from Jamf Pro and utilises it thereafter across all other sessions. This is eqivalent to a sticky session.
- For non Jamf Cloud customers, with load balanced configurations please use `custom_cookies` and configure a custom cookie to be used in all requests instead.

### Concurrency

- You can adjust paralellism by setting the Terraform parallelism count using `terraform apply -parallelism=X` (the default is 10). [HashiCorp Docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/apply#parallelism-n)
- The provider remains stable using paralellism of up to 50, going beyond is at your own risk!


## Configuration Schema

### `jamfpro_instance_fqdn`
- **Type:** String
- **Required:** Yes
- **Default:** Fetched from environment variable `envKeyJamfProUrlRoot` if not provided
- **Description:** The base URL for the Jamf Pro instance. Example: `https://mycompany.jamfcloud.com`. This URL is used to interact with the Jamf Pro API.
