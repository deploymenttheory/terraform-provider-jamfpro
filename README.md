## Introduction

This repository hosts the Community Jamf Pro terraform Provider, built to integrate Jamf Pro's robust configuration management capabilities with Terraform's Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach to service life cycle management. Utilizing a comprehensive JAMF Pro SDK [go-api-sdk-jamfpro](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/go-api-sdk-jamfpro), which serves as a cohesive abstraction layer over both Jamf Pro and Jamf Pro Classic APIs, this provider ensures seamless API interactions and brings a wide array of resources under Terraform's management umbrella.

The jamfpro provider is engineered to enrich your CI/CD workflows with Jamf Pro's extensive device management functionalities, encompassing device enrollment, inventory tracking, security compliance, and streamlined software deployment.

Its primary goal is to enhance the efficiency of managing, deploying, and maintaining Apple devices across your infrastructure, fostering an 'everything-as-code' mindset.

## Demo Implementation

To help you get started and understand the practical implementation of this provider, we've created a comprehensive demo repository:

- **Demo Repository**: [Terraform Demo Jamf Pro](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/terraform-demo-jamfpro)

This demo repository showcases a real-world implementation of the Jamf Pro Terraform provider. It's designed to:

1. Illustrate best practices for integrating Jamf Pro with Terraform.
2. Demonstrate a GitLab-flow based workflow for multi environment setups, integrating with Terraform Cloud.
3. Provide practical examples of managing Jamf Pro resources as code.
4. Offer a starting point for your own infrastructure-as-code initiatives with Jamf Pro.

We encourage you to explore this repository to:

- Understand how to structure your Terraform configurations for Jamf Pro.
- See examples of defining and managing various Jamf Pro resources.
- Learn how to integrate Terraform workflows with your CI/CD pipeline.
- Get insights into version control strategies for your Jamf Pro configurations.

Whether you're new to Terraform or looking to enhance your existing Jamf Pro management, this demo repository serves as a valuable resource to kickstart your infrastructure-as-code journey with Jamf Pro.

  mandatory_request_delay_milliseconds = 100
  
}
```

The provider contains:

- Resources and data sources for Jamf Pro entities (`internal/provider/`),
- Examples [examples](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/terraform-provider-jamfpro/tree/main/examples) directory for sample configurations and usage scenarios of the `terraform-provider-jamfpro` provider.
- Documentation [docs](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/terraform-provider-jamfpro/tree/main/docs)

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) >= 1.11.0
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.22.4
- [Jamf Pro](https://www.jamf.com/) >= 11.15.0

(Tested with production Jamf Pro instances, with and without SSO integratioin with Microsoft Entra ID. We do not test against beta or preview versions of Jamf Pro due to potential data model changes.)

## Getting Started with Examples

### Provider Configuration for Jamf Pro in Terraform

This documentation provides a detailed explanation of the configuration options available in the `provider.tf` file for setting up the Jamf Pro provider in Terraform.

### Jamf Cloud Load Balancing and Cookies

- Jamf Cloud uses a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple web app members (typically 2). When resource's are manipulated on a given web app member, there is up to a 60 second time box until this resources changes are propagated and reflected onto the other web app(s). This architecture can cause issues with Terraform's http client default behaviour when multiple instances are running in parallel and also due to the speed terraform operates. This results in scenarios where it's very likely that a create by terraform, followed by a read (for stating) will freqently communicate with different web app members during a terraform run. This causes stating 'unfound' resource issues.
- To mitigate this please use the `jamfpro_load_balancer_lock` (which enforces a single cookie across all parallel instances of Terraform operations). This feature on first run obtains all available web cookies (jpro-ingress) from Jamf Pro and selects and applies a single one to the http client for all subsequent api calls during the terraform run. This is eqivalent to a sticky session.
- For non Jamf Cloud customers, with load balanced configurations please use `custom_cookies` and configure a custom cookie to be used in all requests instead.

### Concurrency

> [!WARNING]
> Jamf Pro produces inconsistent behaviour when using the default parallelism setting of 10 with terraform. You can adjust paralellism by setting the Terraform parallelism count using `terraform apply -parallelism=X` to a setting of your choice. [HashiCorp Docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/apply#parallelism-n) . It's recconmended to set parallelism to 1 to guarantee successful CRUD operations and resource stating, what this produces in a moderate performance hit is offset by reliability. Not using a `-parallelism=1` is at your own risk!
